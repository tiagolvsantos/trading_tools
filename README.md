# trading_tools

This is a mix of unreliable and unpredictable tools for trading the markets.

The code was created without testing and was crafted during sleepless nights and mid-day coffee breaks. 

Use at your own peril. 


I have a plan to move this forward and keep adding features, but please be aware that this is not the best tool in the world. 

For this, I agree with the principle 'It works on my machine'. Don't hesitate to use it or send pull requests.
